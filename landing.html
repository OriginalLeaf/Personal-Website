                    I am a recent graduate of the University of Texas at Austin. In gaining a B.A.
                    in Government and minor in Computer Science I have grown to learn that I am
                    excited about understanding complex issues, implementing organization systems,
                    and being part of meaningful interactions. The programming skills that I gained
                    in my Computer Science minor complimented my government degree perfectly. I
                    learned new logical frameworks and skills that aided me in understanding complex
                    concepts, as well as programming skills that helped me to analyze large and
                    exciting data sets effectively. My degree has taught me that every interaction
                    has a larger impact, and I hope to be able to bring that realization with me
                    into my future career.

                    While I was a student at the University of Texas, I worked within the University
                    Residence Halls as a Resident Assistant and was responsible for cultivating
                    community and forming positive relationships with over thirty new residents each
                    year. Sending out concise and easily digestible communication was a key part of
                    my role as a Resident Assistant. I believe that my experience as an RA has
                    bolstered my ability to create positive relationships with all people, and
                    allowed me to meaningfully serve my peers.

                    A major component of being an RA was the planning and execution of events, both
                    in person and virtual, each month. I would be responsible for purchasing,
                    organizing, advertising, and executing these unique events for hundreds of
                    residents. While planning these events I worked within both small and large
                    teams and learned the importance of effective communication to both my peers and
                    my supervisors.
                    <br><br>
                    As an RA , I was responsible for an On-Call rotation where I responded
                    effectively to situations, from maintenance needs to crisis events. These tasks
                    allowed me to gain the ability to quickly think and create solutions in a
                    variety of environments, something that I believe is a crucial skill to develop.

                    In general, I believe that my previous experience has given me the skills to
                    succeed in any future role that I find myself in.
